# Since Docker users are looking for the smallest possible final images, the
# following emerges as a very common pattern:

#   RUN apt-get update \
#       && apt-get install --assume-yes --no-install-recommends <packages> \
#       && <do some compilation work> \

# The default Debian recommendations is assuming that the system is a desktop,
# or other system where you don't mind a lot of nice to haves
# This includes packages recommending X11, fonts, etc.
# In most cases you do not want this in a container environment, unless it is
# truely needed.
# Disabling these by default results in the user being a bit more explicit about
# what they want to have installed.
